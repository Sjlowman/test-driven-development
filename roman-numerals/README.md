Roman_numerals exercise. Instructions, followed by my plan/logic
Instructions - part 1 ðŸ‘‰ Read the Roman Numerals Kata requirements. You can find it in the following link: https://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/ (there are many websites like Coding Dojo outlining the most popular Katas, one of them is the Roman Numerals Kata). ðŸ‘‰ Please note that the kata â€˜cluesâ€™ section refers to some C# testing frameworks like XUnit, please ignore these. ðŸ‘‰ Solve the Roman Numerals kata in the programming language for the programme you are attending, if you are unsure, please reach out to a tech coach. ðŸ‘‰ Please set aside up to to make a start on this Kata, donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t reach a full solution as this Kata is designed for you to practise test-driven development and understand the process. We don't expect you to have finished the solution but that you have had a good go at using Test-Driven Development.
ðŸ’¡Tips & Tricks on how to get started Set up your Code Editor / IDE beforehand so youâ€™re ready to write the unit tests and code. Before you write your code, make sure you understand the problem statement. The Kata may seem large at first, so break it down into smaller, manageable pieces. Please note down your test cases, inputs and outputs on a notepad like Word / Notepad++ / piece of paper to validate your understanding. Use the Triple A Structure - Arrange, Act, Assert to guide you when writing your unit tests Use the RED - GREEN - REFACTOR cycle: Write one failing test first and write the simplest code to make that test pass, commit the code, then see if there is any opportunity to refactor. If not, move onto writing your next test and follow the cycle through as you build up your solution. Remember to consider a range of different test cases and edge cases.
ðŸ’¡Apply PseudoCode to help you think through your logic Pseudocode is a description of the steps for an algorithm and can be used to help you think through your logic.

Roman numerals
Start with simply receiving 1 and returning I

Then test receiving a non-number and adding error handling

Then go back to testing 1 but make the code calculate the I, rather than simply returning 1 for everything.

Key switch points for Roman numerals are at multiples of 5 and 10 in the units, tens, hundreds and thousands column

Also make sure that 0s are handled properly

Rules:
Divide it by 1000 and deal with the 1000 part first, and pass on the remainder to the 100 section. Put any 1000 result at the start of the romanString. If it's 5 = V, 4 = MV, 3 = MMM, 2 = MM, 1 = M
Divide the remainder by 100 and deal with the 100 part next. Apend the 100 result to the romanString and pass the remainder to the 10 section
Divide the remainder by 10 and deal with the 10 part next. Apend the 10 result to the romanString and pass the remainder to the unit section
Work out the unit section and apend that to the romanString
Return romanString
Examples of a 1000+ number series:
1370 MCCCLXX, 1371 MCCCLXXI, 1372 MCCCLXXII, 1373 MCCCLXXIII, 1374 MCCCLXXIV,
1375 MCCCLXXV, 1376 MCCCLXXVI, 1377 MCCCLXXVII, 1378 MCCCLXXVIII, 1379 MCCCLXXIX

Take the number that's been input and see if it has any thousands (using Math.floor(x/1000, or by simply converting to string and going through one by one) > 0
Yes: Generate the thousands part using the algorithm and put that in the resultString (or store in thousandsDecimal) || Go onto the hundreds by passing number % 1000
Take the remainder and see if it has any hundreds (using Math.floor(x/100) > 0
Yes: Generate the hundreds part using the algorithm and apend* that onto the resultString (or store in hundredsDecimal) || Go onto the tens by passing number % 100
Take the remainder and see if it has any tens (using Math.floor(x/10) > 0
Yes: Generate the tens part using the algorithm and apend* that onto the resultString (or store in tensDecimal) || Go onto the units by passing number % 10
Take the remainder and see if it has any units (using Math.floor(x/1) > 0
Yes: Generate the units part using the algorithm and apend\* that onto the resultString (or store in unitsDecimal)

return the resulting string/go onto the string generation

- might be better to store these codes in thousandsRoman, hundreedsRoman, tensRoman and unitsRoman for now, and return the concatenation.

Format for the number generation - for the Thousands, the lower should be M, the mid should be V, not needed any higher (mid not even really needed - should I return an error if the number is > 4000?) - for the Hundreds, the lower should be C, the mid code should be D, the upper should be M - for the tens, the lower should be X, the mid should be L, the upper should be C - for the units, the lower should be I, the mid should be V, the upper should be X

Use a template and update it using either string replace/regEx.
Pattern/algorithm is
0: ""
1: lower
2: lowerLower
3: lowerLowerLower
4: lowerMid
5: mid
6: midLower
7: midLowerLower
8: midLowerLowerLower
9: lowerUpper
10 upper

In shorthand code for the regEx:
0: ""
1: l
2: ll
3: lll
4: lm
5: m
6: ml
7: mll
8: mlll
9: lu
10 u

\w
var result = str.replace(/l/g, lower).replace(/m/g, mid).replace(/u/g, upper);

Started off with this initial logic, now refined
If it's divisible by 1000 exactly, then take the first number (Note, this is a dashed V, so don't cover this yet. Also technically true for all of the thousands but given there is an M in them, this can be overlooked and properly tested for now)
5 = V, 4 = MV, 3 = MMM, 2 = MM, 1 = M
If it's divisible by 100 exactly, then take the first number:
5 = D 4 - CD - 3 - CCC 2 - CC 1 - C

5 V .......anything that ends in a 5 has a V at the end. To check if it ends in a 5, you could check if %5 is 0 and %2 is not
6 VI
7 VII
8 VIII
9 IX
10 X ......anything that ends in a 0 has an X at the end? Unless it's 50 or a multiple of 100 or a multiple of 1000
